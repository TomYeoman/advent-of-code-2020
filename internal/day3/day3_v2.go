/*
	Requirements (V1)
		- Every 5 minutes, we're going to start a game which has a slope,
		and a bunch of tobannists wanting to ride a slope

	Step 1 - Define the API on the concrete implementation. We're optimise for correctness on first pass - defining the concrete types

		Primitive API
		--------------
		As we're dealing with state we can use a type based API
			- A tobaggan
				- `rideSlope` method uses pointer semantics, and checks a riders path down
			- A Slope
				- `generateTerrain` method uses pointer semantics, to build a useable Grid of terrain

		We could now use these alone, but we may add one more entity
			A Ski park - wraps our rider, and slopes into a single entity. It's API may form
			/ part of a higher level API

		Low Level API
		--------------
		Now we move onto the low level API. As soon as we're not dealing with state we can move back to a function based API.

		The low level API provides a wrapper over the primitive. Maybe we only want 1 rider to be able to run at a time, in our case
			- `rideSlope` is responsible for sending 1 rider at time down

		High Level API
		--------------
		These types of API deal with multiple behaviours. In our case our requirements say we
		"wish to start a game every X5minutes, that has a slope and riders". Lets define a high level API to help with this -
			- OpenPark - It's a function based API, that is going to be responsible for building terrains, and sending riders down them,
